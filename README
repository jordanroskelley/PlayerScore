Hi, welcome to my README and thanks for opening it. This is my first git project,
and so I'm just trying to figure it all out with this simple app that I've been writing.
I'm writing using AIDE for Android, and it's pretty cool so far.

In settings, you can add players. It stores those players in a json string
in the shared preferences. I may eventually need a database, but shared preferences
works for now.

Then you can start a game, choose players, enter scores, and see totals. It keeps state on
rotation for the game. That's about it for now. There are still a bunch of bugs and
stuff, but that's where we are.

To do:
-check that saves exist before showing load menu (otherwise, FC)
-create small screen friendly views
-Ability to use initials instead of name for small screens (and decrease the round name TextView size)
-Will also need a way to calculate (or have stored) initials
-a way to delete saved games without having to load and 'finish' them
-check rotation on settings
