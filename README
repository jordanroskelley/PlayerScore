Hi, welcome to my readme... and thanks for opening it. This is my first git project,
and so I'm just trying to figure it all out with this simple app that I've been writing.
I'm writing using AIDE for android, and it's pretty cool so far.

You can add players, in setting. It stores those players in a json string
in the shared preferences. I may eventually need a database, but prefs works for now :)

Then you can start a game, choose players, enter scores, and see totals.

Todo:
add scroll view to table (or convert first row to linearlayout and wrap table in sv)...
rotating loses context and clears data
layout still kinda sucks
ability to use initials instead of name for small screens
lifecycle in scoreview
ability to save/resume game
