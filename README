Hi, welcome to my README and thanks for opening it. This is my first git project,
and so I'm just trying to figure it all out with this simple app that I've been writing.
I'm writing using AIDE for Android, and it's pretty cool so far.

In settings, you can add players. It stores those players in a json string
in the shared preferences. I may eventually need a database, but shared preferences
works for now.

Then you can start a game, choose players, enter scores, and see totals. That's about
it for now. There are still a bunch of bugs and stuff, but that's where we are.

To do in ScoreView.java:
-Convert first row to LinearLayout and wrap table in ScrollView
--To go along with that, create a hidden LinearLayout to go at the bottom to show live totals
--And with that, a menu with options to: finish, save, show totals, etc
-Rotating the device isn't handled... therefore you lose your game. Handle this!
-Ability to use initials instead of name for small screens (and decrease the round name TextView size)
--Will also need a way to calculate (or have stored) initials
-Ability to save/resume game, which will help with the following
--Handle life cycle in ScoreView
